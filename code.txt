hello world 
this is my local machine code that will be pushed to git later.
this is something new 

we have different methods to print a statement on the console or terminal for every progaramming language
like we use 
printf("hello world ") in C ,
console.log("hello world") in Java Script,
Sytem.out.print("hello world") in Java,
print("hello world" ) in Python

this is from new feature1
so im basically working on this new feature in my app so i created a new branch for it
 here now i would like to add mroe features and merge it to the main branch
 this is again main branch
